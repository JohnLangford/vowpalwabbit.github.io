description: Contextual Bandits are a framing of reinforcement learning, where one observes the environment, makes a decision, and observes a reward, and optimizes for it. It is not like full reinforcement learning, because it assumes decisions are independent, and every decision observes a reward; most RL systems in production in the real world are CB solvers.
